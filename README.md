# Positioning and Floating Elements

This is the [Positioning and Floating Elements Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements) from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) [HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/).  This is a clone of a New York Times article built using only HTML5 and CSS to practice positioning elements conventionally, with flexbox, and with grid.
